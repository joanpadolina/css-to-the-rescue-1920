## Concept

For this course of breaking te internet I wanted to make an artist page of Billie Eillish. Because of the variety of songs she has produced she gave me an inspiration to make a cover website dedicated to her.

## Goals
* Work with **SVG illustration** and animate this with css-only
* Make two versions of the website which is **light and dark**
* **No** squares or circles in the endproduct
* And **selector only** selection on targets

## Personal goal
1. Get to know how the CSS selector works with **barely** use of classes.
1. Animate SVG elements made in illustrator and create an interaction with this.
1. Have fun and try thinking out of the box.
1. Don't be afraid to fail.
1. Make it as crazy as possible.
1. Let the user explore.

## What is new for me after CSS-to-the-rescue?

`reflection`

Personally I've almost never worked this detailed with CSS. I knew you could do crazy stuff with only css but I never thought to be able to experiment this during school. 

* **nth-of-type // first-of-type**

First thing I've tried is to use less classes and fully focused on specification withing the html elements. This, for me, was the most challenging this to do because I only knew the class and id selecting method. I do understand the benefits using this methods.

The first reason why I like this method is the easiness of selection the elements. You don't have to rememeber te classes you make and it's more efficient. 

It is more reliable and I didn't know you can go as far as selection direct child or parents of elements. The syntax `~ >` does the job better than expected.

### ~
This selects every element that are preceded of an element.

### >
Selecting the child of the direct parent.

### +
Select the element that are placed immediately after an element.


 The only down-side for a beginner is to know wat your the `parent` and what you're trying to select. This can be tricky if you are trying to select something that is not inside the parent. This gives a lot of frustration if it's not working.



* **keyframes**

Animations are the best in CSS. They are so fun to make and in this course you can go as far as you can. I felt a little hold back by myself because I couldn't see past the basic styling of css. The animation with keyframes where great to be able experiment because I cannot see me trying to experiment in the free time I have. There's a lot you can do in the era so this was very fun.

I felt like I didn't experiment enough, I stayed with the percentage from 0 to 100 and that's about it. Inside the animation I've tried a lot with the transform especially the rotation.

* **SVG**

This part was a lot of fun and experimening. The only way I used svgs from illustrator are for icons. I've changed the color with wil on hover and that's about it.

After making a fast vector of my concept I've noticed that, there are a lot of groups. There is a lot of everything. This was the most 'headache' activating project. You are constantly looking for the right group or selection in the svg. 
But once you get the hang of it, it gets a lot easier when using the child selector.

To be able to select individual svg element gave you more options and opened doors in animation.


* **writing-mode // text-orientation**

In my project I used some lyrics from Billie for the background and some for the foreground. I did a basic skew and rotation of some interaction but this was not full filling. So I dig a little to animating the lyrics and came across the writing-mode.

After using this the background got more interesting and felt like breaking the internet. I can see how fun this can be if your using some animation. 


* **::before // ::after**

This is so powerfull if you can change the content of the element. I've noticed you can place things before and after an element. This can me a logo or instead of placing an icon in html you can also place it with the before/after.




### Feedback // Vitaly

For the first feedback from Vitaly we came to a conclusion that the way my creation is set there is so much room for craziness. My interaction was a lot less and needed some more love. I've done this by adding some hover on **invisible** corners where to lyrics would go bend to that corner. My initial thought was "I need Javascript to achieve this" but Vasillis was like "naah-aahh you don't" so the outcome was pretty fun without javscript.

I've told on the first feedback that the lightness and darkness are still work-in-progress.

### Feedback // Daan

Daan was very excited with my work but like any other feedback there is always room for interaction. We both though that only hover won't do justice in this project. Also I've changed the cursor to a spider which didn't make sense in my project. I need something with this spider to active a 'something' in the website. I'm still exploring the magic of CSS and noticed I'm still at the 1% in what CSS actually can do.
Nevertheless I'm still proud in what I've achieved and explored the few days with this course.
Also Dark and Light is hella awesome in my opnion!

### Feedback // Vasilis

Vasilis toldme to try and experiment with the lyrics I had in the background. He showed me the CSS trick [Almanac](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/)
I've never seen this website before so I got excited. Definetly want to start digging through.
