# Billie Eillish Album covers

[Live Demo]()

## Concept

For this course of breaking te internet I wanted to make an artist page of Billie Eillish. Because of the variety of songs she has produced she gave me an inspiration to make a cover website dedicated to her.

## Goals
* Work with **SVG illustration** and animate this with css-only
* Make two versions of the website which is **light and dark**
* **No** squares or circles in the endproduct
* And **selector only** selection on targets

## Learning goals
